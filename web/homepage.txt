<h1>The Evolution of Electric Skateboards - Evolve Skateboards</h1>

<h2><strong>The New Bamboo Series have arrived. We will begin shipping orders shortly.</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Due to demand, USA will be out of carbon series until September! Preorder now!</strong></h2>

<p>Every part of the board from the deck down to the bearings are custom designed to perfection. That&#39;s why the feel you get when riding an Evolve <strong>electric skateboard</strong> is totally unique and rides like no other electric skateboard on the market.</p>

<p>Our electric skateboards are not the oversized, heavy, low quality, hard to carve models that have come before. And, yes, they are lithium powered. The bamboo and carbon street series are under 20 lbs. with a range of up to 20 miles. This is two to three times more than competitors. This is the evolution of <strong>electric skateboarding</strong>. Finally, a board that looks, feels, and most importantly reacts like a traditional longboard.</p>

<h3>The Endless Carve and Recreational Commute</h3>

<p>Like being out in the ocean on a glassy day with the entire break to yourself. Like first runs in fresh powder on a sunny day. That open space feeling with the wind in your face, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ&not;Ã¢â€žÂ¢re controlling the speed. The Evolve Electric Skateboard is lightweight and easy to carry. From an early morning or late afternoon adrenaline laced cruise to commuting where you need to go without the hassles of traffic and parking, you&#039;ll have a smile on your face when you Evolve.</p>
